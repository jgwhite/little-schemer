# Little Schemer book club

In which we write a ruby interpreter for scheme and use it to work
through the [Little Schemer
book](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/).

Join the [Understanding Computation mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/computationbook) if you want to
be involved in discussions about the book club.

We'll be using [Treetop](https://github.com/cjheath/treetop) as the
basis for the interpreter we write. If you've not used it before then
[Aaron Gough's introduction to
Treetop](http://thingsaaronmade.com/blog/a-quick-intro-to-writing-a-parser-using-treetop.html)
is a good primer.
